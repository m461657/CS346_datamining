# CS346_datamining
Projects for data mining course (capstone course; in R)

## Project 1 

This project used Naive Bayes and Classification Tree models to generate predictions on unseen data. The project included some data munging (balancing, normalizing, cleaning) and then analyzed the generated predictions of each model to compare the results.

## Final Project

This project was conducted in a similar format to the first project, but instead used neural networks. There was still data munging and analyses performed.
